                For my final project of my 200-level animation class, I combined traditional, hand-drawn animation with modern 3D graphics. 
                The character was hand-drawn, inked and coloured, then imported into Blender. 
                Using Blender nodes, I removed the white background of the paper from the character so that it fit within the 3D space. 
                I also created the music that goes along with this short animaition as well.

                I wanted to take a different approach to animation by using a unique medium, so for my final project of my 300-level animation class, I created a world made out of felt. 
                I created virtual puppets by cutting the shapes of the characters out of felt. 
                I then removed the backrounds of all of the characters' different componenets and imported them into Adobe Character Animator. 
                I then created music and dialog that would be used for timing the characters' animations.

                I made this animation to serve as a representation of someone very special. 
                It tells a story about a strong, resilient Afghan woman who had to overcome a lot to find peace. 
                I encourage you to search for the significance of August 15th, 2021, because for a lot of people it means nothing, 
                and for many who have known about it, it seems lost and forgotten. 
                However, for her and many others like her, their lives were changed forever, and they will never have the privilege of forgetting.</div>

                I was in charge of the art and animation for my group's final project for our 300-level video game development class. I wanted our game to really stand out graphically, so I decided to use the felt medium that I had used earlier in my animation class. This time, I really refined the animation process, and made around 200 frames of character sprites, as well as environment and UI assests, all out of felt.
